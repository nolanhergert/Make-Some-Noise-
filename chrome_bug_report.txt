  * Does not repro with the HTML file on the web
  * Does not repro with a local sound file.

  
My use case was for a game show using Google Slides which had transition sounds, as well as a "score-keeping" laptops that listened for a web API to play a sound. Both stopped working properly after 5 minutes.

Based on the test file, I'm not sure why the Google Slides didn't work, but maybe it's running off a cached HTML file.
