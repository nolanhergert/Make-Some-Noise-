# Make Some Noise game 
## Setup
Need to create new namespace in CountAPI: https://countapi.xyz/

## Presentation
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1T83CA6iQEwqv_jJAU6c4FYoxPB4Vxi2K9WluKOVwVHU/edit?usp=sharing is the presentation. I ran it in presenter mode, which is the same use case as the score-keeping laptops. Might want to test in non-presenter mode too.
