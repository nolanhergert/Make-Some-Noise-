# Make Some Noise game 
## Setup
Need to create new namespace in CountAPI: https://countapi.xyz/. However it's down as of April 20 2024 :(

## Presentation
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1T83CA6iQEwqv_jJAU6c4FYoxPB4Vxi2K9WluKOVwVHU/edit?usp=sharing is the presentation. I ran it in presenter mode, which is the same use case as the score-keeping laptops. Might want to test in non-presenter mode too.

# Chrome Repro

  * Here's the link. https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40065055. Need to use firefox since Google Slides won't let you use any files other than on Google Drive
